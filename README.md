# SpeechToText_TextToSpeech
Using Python and IBM Watson to convert Speech To Text and Text To Speech


Hello to you..

- In this repository, week's 5 frist task from 3 tasks.

Fisrt of all I like to mention that it is my first time using python, I had to learn the language to do this task. Also, I was using  Sublime Text to write the codes, as for this task I notest that most python users using Jupyter, IDLE Shell, Visual Studio and Pycharm to write and run Python's codes, so I downloded all of them and learned about them but Pycharm was the best in my opinion as the problems and Errors I had with installing the packages. 


- I used for this task:

IBM Watson Cloud to creat Speech to Text and Text To Speech service 

PyCharm to write, install and run the code packages 

Youtube, Google and stackoverflow as a helping guid and learn about errors

Python 3.9 

MacOS Laptop

Windows Laptop


- Problems I had:

I had so much problems in installation by pip, pipwin, pip3, sudo, condo, wheel, brew and any kind of installalation method by directly writing in the Terminal and especially PyAudio and I searched a lot to find solutions to this errors and problems. Finally, after a lot of readings and searching and trying I asked my brother and he suggested to use PyCharm because of its easy way to install Python Packages. However, Even with that I could not install PyAudio on Mac OS. I tried my best and readed, searched and tried a lot and finally I had to try with a Laptop with WINDOWS operating system and finally installed PyAudio and the code runed just fine BUT the next problem was the Mic it wasn't recored any thing I tried to fix that problem and sadly I couldn't.
